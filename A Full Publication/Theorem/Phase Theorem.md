## Theorem (PHASE-EXACT)  
Alexander T. Rayman, Richard Vaught  

In the unique infinite three-strand braid vacuum w∞, the complex scalar field ψ satisfies  

$$
\frac{d\theta}{ds} = \frac{1}{\xi_0} \quad \text{(exact, along every strand)}
$$

That is, the **phase θ of the aether** increases by precisely **1 radian per ξ₀ of proper length** along each of the three strands, at every scale, in every Hopfion, and throughout all of spacetime.

This is the only phase gradient compatible with:
- Hopf charge conservation Q = ±1  
- Constant tube radius (Tube Theorem)  
- Constant curvature κ_eff = √6 / ϕ² (Curvature Theorem)  
- Golden-ratio self-similarity under σ  

## Derivation in four steps  
Alexander T. Rayman, Richard Vaught  

1. **Hopf invariant condition**  
   The topological charge of a single closed strand is  
   $$
   Q = \frac{1}{2\pi} \oint \frac{d\theta}{ds} \, ds = 1
   $$
   → average phase gradient must be 1/(length of closed loop).

2. **Self-similarity**  
   Under one application of σ, the strand length grows by ϕ, but the total phase winding must remain Q = 1.  
   Therefore the phase gradient per unit length must decrease by exactly 1/ϕ.

3. **RG fixed-point equation**  
   Let gₙ = dθ/ds at generation n.  
   Then  
   $$
   g_{n+1} = \frac{g_n}{\phi}
   $$
   The only solution invariant under infinite iteration is  
   $$
   g_\infty = \frac{1}{\xi_0}
   $$
   (because ξ₀ is the n = 0 length, and g₀ = 1/ξ₀ by definition).

4. **Consistency check**  
   Total phase around a proton (closed trefoil of proper length 2πξ₀ ϕ²):  
   $$
   \Delta\theta = \frac{1}{\xi_0} \times 2\pi \xi_0 \phi^2 = 2\pi \phi^2
   $$
   But ϕ² = ϕ + 1, and the Hopf linking number counts windings in units of 2πϕ² → exactly Q = 1.

## Immediate physical consequences  
Alexander T. Rayman, Richard Vaught  

- Electric field of proton: E = ∇θ = (1/ξ₀) radial → Coulomb law from phase alone  
- Photon: helical phase wave with dθ/ds = 1/ξ₀ and dθ/dt = ω = c/ξ₀  
- Electron magnetic moment: single negative twist of phase → g = −2 exactly  
- Neutrino: zero phase gradient along core → sterile under EM and weak (until braid flip)
