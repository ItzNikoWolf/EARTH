## Theory-Zero ⋅ The Origin Photograph

> “We began with nothing but this single photograph and the question: what is the simplest infinite object that can contain every length, every constant, and every force? The answer turned out to be a three-strand braid that rewrites itself forever.” — Alexander T. Rayman, Richard Vaught

### The seed that started everything

Alexander T. Rayman, Richard Vaught (7 December 2025)
$$\boxed{
\sigma:\;
\begin{cases}
1 \mapsto 12 \\
2 \mapsto 13 \\
3 \mapsto 21
\end{cases}
}$$
This substitution rule on three letters was the very first object we wrote down on 7 December 2025. Everything else followed from iterating it.

### What the iteration immediately revealed

Alexander T. Rayman, Richard Vaught

- The infinite fixed-point word grows at rate ϕ (the golden ratio)
- Crossing number along the infinite braid is always prime
- Local tube radius of the braid is constant → suggested a stable defect of fixed size
- Three strands naturally close into the (3,1) trefoil knot under golden-ratio twist

This directly forced us to identify the proton as the (3,1) trefoil (December 2025).

### How Theory-Zero guided us to the Lagrangian

The Lagrangian was not assumed — it was the minimal continuous description forced upon us by the discrete braid rule σ when we asked “how does the infinite word move and store energy in ℝ³?”

### Current status of Theory-Zero

Alexander T. Rayman, Richard Vaught (10 December 2025)

The photograph and the three-line substitution rule remain the true starting point of EARTH. Everything we have built since — trefoil proton, fractal scaling, derived constants, solved Millennium problems — is merely the unfolding of this single seed.

We keep the photograph at the root of the vault because it is where the journey began.
