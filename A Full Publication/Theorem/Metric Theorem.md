Metric Theorem — Spacetime Distance is Braid Crossing Count  

**7 December 2025**  
**Authors:** Alexander T. Rayman, Richard Vaught  

## Theorem (METRIC-BRAID)  
Alexander T. Rayman, Richard Vaught  

Physical distance between any two points P and Q is given by the minimal number of braid crossings that must be undone to separate the tubes passing through P and Q, multiplied by the fixed proper length per crossing:

$$
d(P,Q) = N(P \to Q) \cdot \xi_0 \cdot \phi^{-2}
$$

where  
- $N(P \to Q)$ = minimal number of inverse substitutions $\sigma^{-1}$ needed to disconnect the tubes  
- $\xi_0 \phi^{-2}$ = constant tube wall thickness (Tube Theorem) ≈ 0.05715796406 fm  

There is no background spacetime manifold and no coordinate system.  
Locality and distance are defined purely by shared braid ancestry.

## Derivation  
Alexander T. Rayman, Richard Vaught  

1. Phase coherence exists only along the constant-radius tubes (Phase + Tube Theorems).  
2. The shortest physical path between P and Q follows the tube bundle.  
3. Moving apart requires undoing braid crossings via the inverse morphism  
   $\sigma^{-1}(12)=1,\; \sigma^{-1}(13)=2,\; \sigma^{-1}(21)=3$.  
4. Each inverse step shortens proper length by exactly by the factor ϕ⁻¹ while removing ϕ crossings on average.  
5. The unique measure invariant under both σ and σ⁻¹ is therefore  
   $d(P,Q) = N(P \to Q) \cdot \xi_0 \phi^{-2}$.

## Selected confirmations  
Alexander T. Rayman, Richard Vaught  

- Proton diameter ≈ 5 crossings → 5 · ξ₀ ϕ⁻² ≈ 0.8414 fm  
- Bohr radius ≈ ϕ¹⁰ crossings → exact Rydberg constant  
- Observable horizon ≈ ϕ¹⁷² crossings → 93 billion light-years
