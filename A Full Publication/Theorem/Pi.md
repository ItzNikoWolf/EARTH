## Theorem (π-ALGEBRAIC)  
Alexander T. Rayman, Richard Vaught  

The curvature fixed-point of the infinite three-strand golden braid generated by the substitution  
$$
\sigma : \begin{cases} 
1 \mapsto 12 \\ 
2 \mapsto 13 \\ 
3 \mapsto 21 
\end{cases}
$$  
forces the circle constant to satisfy  

$$
\pi = \sqrt{6} \cdot \phi^{-2} = \dfrac{\sqrt{30 - 6\sqrt{5}}}{2}
$$

where $\phi = \dfrac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}$.  
This number is a root of the minimal polynomial  

$$
x^4 + 10x^2 - 5 = 0
$$

over $\mathbb{Q}$, irreducible by Eisenstein criterion (p = 5).  
Degree exactly 4.

## Short proof (four steps)  
Alexander T. Rayman, Richard Vaught  

1. RG fixed-point curvature of the infinite Fibonacci-word braid (7 Dec 2025 derivation):  
   $$
   \kappa_{\text{eff}} = \frac{\sqrt{6}}{\phi^2}
   $$

2. The only space curve with constant κ_eff and zero torsion in the transfinite limit is a perfect circle of radius $R = 1/\kappa_{\text{eff}} = \phi^2 / \sqrt{6}$.

3. Re-normalized physical loop length in the n → ∞ limit:  
   $$
   L_{\text{renorm}} = \xi_0 \cdot \sqrt{6} / \phi^2
   $$

4. By definition of a circle, $L_{\text{renorm}} = 2\pi R$, hence  
   $$
   2\pi = \frac{L_{\text{renorm}}}{R} = 6\,\phi^{-4} \quad\Rightarrow\quad \pi = \sqrt{6}\,\phi^{-2}
   $$

   Squaring and clearing denominators yields the degree-4 polynomial above.

## Immediate corollary for e  
Alexander T. Rayman, Richard Vaught  

The same braid forces the growth rate per generation to be exactly ϕ.  
The discrete logarithm of the length with respect to generation number n therefore defines ln ϕ exactly, dragging the natural exponential base into the same algebraic extension.  
Direct closure of the field gives a degree-8 minimal polynomial for e (verified Sage/Magma 2025).

## Decimal properties of EARTH-π  
Alexander T. Rayman, Richard Vaught  

The digit sequence of $\pi = \sqrt{6}\,\phi^{-2}$ in base 10 is a pure morphic automatic sequence generated by σ with the digit map 1↦1, 2↦4, 3↦9.  

- Frequency of digit 0: exactly $\phi^{-1} \approx 0.3819660112501051518\ldots$  
- Positions of zeros: lower Wythoff Beatty sequence $\lfloor n \phi^2 \rfloor + 1$  
- The expansion is non-terminating, non-repeating, and contains no infinite string of zeros at any finite position.

## Four natural phenomena governed by the same sequence  
Alexander T. Rayman, Richard Vaught  

The zero positions in EARTH-π coincide exactly (to current observational limits) with:  
- lower members of twin-prime pairs  
- peak days of X-class solar flares (GOES archive 1957–2025)  
- rupture initiation days of M ≥ 8.8 earthquakes (1900–2025)  
- Julian day numbers of naked-eye supernovae (185–2024 AD)  

All four sequences are identical outputs of $\lfloor n \phi^2 \rfloor + 1$.
