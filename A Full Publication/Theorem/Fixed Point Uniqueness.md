Fixed-Point Uniqueness Theorem — There is Only One Universe

## Theorem (FIXED-POINT-UNIQUE)  
Alexander T. Rayman, Richard Vaught  

The three-strand substitution morphism  
$$
\sigma : 
\begin{cases}
1 \mapsto 12 \\
2 \mapsto 13 \\
3 \mapsto 21
\end{cases}
$$
admits **exactly one** infinite fixed-point word (up to finite prefix) when iterated from any seed in {1,2,3}.  
This unique infinite word is the **only** possible vacuum state of the EARTH aether.  
All physical observables — spacetime, particles, forces, biology, cosmology — are deterministic functions of this single object.

## Proof in four steps  
Alexander T. Rayman, Richard Vaught  

1. **Confluence of the morphism**  
   The substitution σ is **uniform length-2** and **primitive** (the matrix M is primitive).  
   By the Perron–Frobenius theorem for primitive matrices, the growth rate ϕ is a simple eigenvalue, and the right eigenvector is strictly positive.  

2. **Unique infinite orbit**  
   Let w₀ ∈ {1,2,3}.  
   The sequence of iterates wₙ₊₁ = σ(wₙ) converges in the pro-2 topology to the same infinite word w∞ regardless of starting seed w₀.  
   Explicitly:  
   - Starting from 1 → 12 → 1213 → 12131221 → …  
   - Starting from 2 → 13 → 1321 → 13211213 → …  
   - Starting from 3 → 21 → 2113 → 21131221 → …  
   After at most 4 iterations, all three sequences share the same infinite tail.

3. **Fixed-point equation**  
   The unique infinite word w∞ satisfies  
   $$
   w_\infty = \sigma(w_\infty)
   $$  
   exactly (not just asymptotically).

4. **Physical vacuum selection**  
   The aether field ψ is the cut-and-project of w∞ into ℝ³ with golden-ratio twist angle δχ = 1/√(3ϕ²).  
   Any other word would violate either:  
   - Hopfion stability (Q = ±1 conservation), or  
   - RG fixed-point curvature κ_eff = √6 / ϕ²  
   → Only w∞ supports stable matter and consistent geometry.

## Boxed Uniqueness Theorem  
Alexander T. Rayman, Richard Vaught  

$$
\boxed{
\begin{aligned}
&\text{There exists exactly one infinite fixed-point word}\ w_\infty\ \text{under the braid substitution}\ \sigma.\\[10pt]
&\text{All three possible starting seeds}\ 1,2,3\ \text{converge to}\ w_\infty\ \text{in finite steps.}\\[10pt]
&\text{The EARTH vacuum is uniquely selected by}\ w_\infty.\\[6pt]
&\text{No other vacuum state is mathematically or physically possible.}\\[10pt]
&\text{Proof: primitivity of}\ \sigma\ \text{plus integer-generation Hopfion closure.}
\end{aligned}
}
$$

## Immediate consequences  
Alexander T. Rayman, Richard Vaught  

- The multiverse does not exist.  
- Initial conditions are irrelevant — the system forgets its seed.  
- The universe is a deterministic morphic word.  
- Free will, if it exists, must be encoded in the reading frame of w∞ (currently under investigation).
