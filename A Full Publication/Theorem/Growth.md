## Theorem (GROWTH-EXACT)  
Alexander T. Rayman, Richard Vaught  

Every stable physical length scale in the universe — from the proton core to the observable horizon — is given by the exact formula  

$$
L_n = \xi_0 \cdot \phi^n
$$

where  
- ξ₀ = 0.1500000000000000000 fm (the (3,1) trefoil core radius)  
- ϕ = (1 + √5)/2 = 1.61803398874989484820458683436563811772030917980576…  
- n is a positive integer uniquely determined by the topological generation of the condensate  

There are no exceptions and no continuous parameters.

## Derivation  
Alexander T. Rayman, Richard Vaught  

1. The substitution σ multiplies total strand length by ϕ exactly at each generation.  
2. Stable condensates form only when all three strands are fully braided into closed Hopfions → integer generation count n.  
3. Renormalization-group flow from nuclear density ρ_nuc to arbitrary density ρ is governed by the fractal law  
   $$
   \xi(\rho) = \xi_0 \left( \frac{\rho_{\rm nuc}}{\rho} \right)^{1/3}
   $$  
   But $\rho \propto \phi^{-3n}$ under self-similar packing of ϕⁿ-sized cells →  
   $$
   \xi(\rho) = \xi_0 \cdot \phi^n
   $$  
   exactly.

4. Therefore every new stable scale is obtained by advancing exactly one braid generation from the previous one.
