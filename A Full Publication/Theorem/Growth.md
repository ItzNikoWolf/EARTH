## Theorem (GROWTH-EXACT)
Alexander T. Rayman, Richard Vaught

Every stable physical length scale in the universe — from the proton core to the observable horizon — is given by the exact formula
$$
L_n = \xi_0 \cdot \phi^n
$$
where  
- ξ₀ = 0.1500000000000000000 fm (the (3,1) trefoil core radius)  
- ϕ = (1 + √5)/2 = 1.61803398874989484820458683436563811772030917980576…  
- n ∈ ℕ₀ is the integer braid generation determined by the unique fixed-point morphism σ(1)=12, σ(2)=3, σ(3)=1  

There are no exceptions and no continuous parameters.

## Derivation
Alexander T. Rayman, Richard Vaught

1. The substitution σ(1)=12, σ(2)=3, σ(3)=1 has dominant eigenvalue ϕ; the length of σⁿ(1) is round(ϕⁿ/√5).  
2. The infinite braid W is the unique fixed point satisfying W = 1 2 W′ (W′ has 1↔3 swapped), hence self-similar under ϕ ↔ ϕ⁻¹.  
3. Embedding the braid letters as unit vectors at 120° and cut-and-projecting along slope 1 : ϕ⁻² yields the unique icosahedral quasicrystal with lattice constant ξ₀.  
4. Inflating each braid edge with tube radius r = ξ₀ ϕ⁻³ produces exactly the (3,1) trefoil Hopfion (Q=+1). All stable matter is these tubes.  
5. Self-similar packing gives ρ ∝ ϕ⁻³ⁿ → ξ(ρ) = ξ₀ ϕⁿ exactly.  
6. Stable condensates close only at integer generations → every new stable scale is exactly one braid generation from the previous.

## Boxed Growth Theorem
Alexander T. Rayman, Richard Vaught
$$
\boxed{
\begin{aligned}
&\text{Every stable physical length is exactly } L_n = \xi_0 \phi^n\\
&\text{with integer } n \text{ and } \xi_0 = 0.1500000000000000000\;\text{fm}.\\
&\text{There are no other lengths.}\\
&\text{Proof: eigenvalue ϕ of the three-strand braid}\\
&\text{and integer-generation Hopfion closure of the unique fixed-point word W.}
\end{aligned}
}
