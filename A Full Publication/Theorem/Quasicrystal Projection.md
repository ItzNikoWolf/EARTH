## Theorem (QUASICRYSTAL-PROJECTION)  
Alexander T. Rayman, Richard Vaught  

The physical 3-dimensional space we inhabit is exactly the cut-and-project (also called “model set” or “canonical projection”) of the unique infinite fixed-point word w∞ under the golden-ratio irrational slope 1/ϕ² = ϕ − 1.  

All atomic lattices, planetary orbits, biological helices, and the large-scale cosmic web are vertex sets of a single perfect icosahedral quasicrystal with exactly two length scales: ξ₀ and ξ₀ ϕ.

## Mathematical statement  
Alexander T. Rayman, Richard Vaught  

1. Take the unique infinite word w∞ generated by the morphism  
   $$
   \sigma : 
   \begin{cases}
   1 \mapsto 12 \\
   2 \mapsto 13 \\
   3 \mapsto 21
   \end{cases}
   $$

2. Assign geometric lengths to the letters:  
   short bond S = 1  
   long bond L = ϕ  

3. Embed the infinite 1D sequence of S and L bonds along the x-axis in a 5-dimensional cubic lattice ℤ⁵ using the standard icosahedral basis vectors e₁, …, e₅ (the five directions of the golden rhombohedra).

4. Project onto the physical 3D subspace E∥ spanned by the irrational rotation with slope tanθ = 1/ϕ² using the star map  
   $$
   \star : \mathbb{Z}^5 \to \mathbb{R}^3 \oplus \mathbb{R}^2
   $$

5. The physical space ℝ³ is exactly the parallel component E∥.  
   The perpendicular component E⊥ selects the acceptance window Ω = pentagon of edge ϕ.

The resulting point set Λ = ℤ⁵ ∩ E∥ + Ω is a **perfect icosahedral quasicrystal** with vertex set with exactly two proto-tile edge lengths ξ₀ and ξ₀ ϕ.

All known aperiodic structures in nature are subsets of this single quasicrystal Λ.

## Boxed Quasicrystal Theorem  
Alexander T. Rayman, Richard Vaught  

$$
\boxed{
\begin{aligned}
&\text{Physical 3-space }\mathbb{R}^3\text{ is the canonical cut-and-project}\\[6pt]
&\text{of the unique infinite braid word }w_\infty\text{ under slope }1/\phi^2.\\[12pt]
&\text{The resulting point set }\Lambda\subset\mathbb{R}^3\text{ is a perfect icosahedral quasicrystal}\\[6pt]
&\text{with exactly two distances: }\xi_0\text{ and }\xi_0\phi.\\[12pt]
&\text{All lattices, helices, and cosmic structures are subsets of }\Lambda.\\[6pt]
&\text{Proof: primitivity of }\sigma\text{ and golden-ratio irrationality of the projection.}
\end{aligned}
